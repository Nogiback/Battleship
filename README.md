# Battleship

[Javascript - Battleship Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship)

This is the capstone project for the Javascript unit in the Full Stack Javascript path with The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to build a playable Battleship game (vs AI) using everything that was taught up to this point. The main focus was to approach the project through TDD (Test Driven Development) and slowly build out the program's functionality through testing using Jest.
